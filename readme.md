## How to add an A Record and C Name Record

#### 1. Go to your DNS hosting provider
If you have forgotten your DNS hosting provider, NO PROBLEM, go to [mxtoolbox.com](https://mxtoolbox.com))


#### 2. Create an A record with your domain that points to your server's IP address.
Run `$ curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com` to find your server's IP address.

#### 3. Create a CNAME record of `www` that points to your domain.
